# Social Sim Prototyping

The purpose of this project is to provide a place to test different ideas for my social simulation project.

In general, I like to prototype things in python, then rewrite them in whatever language I would like the final product to be in. 
Because this is mostly a place to test out ideas, a lot of the code here will not work.
The goal is not to have a working program from this code; the goal is to put my ideas into code so that I can see where my thinking makes sense and where it does not.
As a result, this repository contains a lot of incomplete code.
I will often write comments in place of larger blocks of code which would take more time to write.

## Structure

This repository is split into two different sections: client and server.
In the early stages of this project, the client is mainly for testing because my first goal is to create a working simulation server.
This will change over time as the client-side applications become more elaborate.
